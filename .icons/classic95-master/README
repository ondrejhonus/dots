My modified version of the Classic95 Icon Theme.
It includes some fixes for Xubuntu, like:

- Bluetooth status icon
- Bluetooth mouse battery level icon

Original Classic95 Webpage:

Original README:

Classic icons for GNOME/MATE based on Windows 95.
This new version was developed for the MATE desktop, so more icons will be changed in MATE than in GNOME. This will be the last release in a while. It is still incomplete, but a large improvement over previous versions. Looks very good with the Classic95 and Tux-Overlay Matenu/Gnomenu themes (seen in the screenshot). The gtk theme in the screenshot is Xfce-Redmond with the Xfce engine commented out. I hope this update will be enjoyed, it was fun to put this together.
